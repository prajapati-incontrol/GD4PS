# Graph Data for Power Flow 
## Power Calculation
- Faster power flow calculation. Traditional ML does not exploit intrinsic network topology of power systems, resulting in lower accuracy.
- ChebNet already available.
- Does not simply imitate NR Solver.
- Faster than even NR Solver.
### Research Directions 
1. The distribution networks are constantly changing. When the nodes and branches of the distribution networks increase, the trained models cannot be used directly. So, how to fine tune the trained model 
through transfer learning so that the model can be applied to the expanded distribution networks.
2. Alternative GCNs model and further investigation about the architecture improvements can be considered in future.
