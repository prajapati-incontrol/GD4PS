# Review of topics covered in ML for Graph Data Course: CS4350

## Lecture 1: Graph terminology
- simple graphs: w/o self-loops and multi-edges
- multi-graphs: with self-loops and multi-edges
- Sub-graph = Induced graph = subset of graph
- trail, path, walk, cycle
- Adjacency matrix ($O(N^2)$), gaph density, adjacency list ($O(E)$), edge list
- Directed vs. Undirected Graphs
- Connected vs. Disconnected Graphs
-
